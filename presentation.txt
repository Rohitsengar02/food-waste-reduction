# FOOD SHARE - COMBATING FOOD WASTAGE

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Food Share is a modern web application designed to combat food wastage by connecting individuals and businesses with excess food to those who need it. The platform facilitates both food donations and sales of surplus food at discounted prices, creating a sustainable ecosystem that reduces waste and promotes community engagement.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Approximately one-third of all food produced globally goes to waste, resulting in significant environmental impact and economic losses. Meanwhile, many people struggle with food insecurity. Food Share addresses this disconnect by creating a direct channel between food suppliers with surplus and potential consumers or beneficiaries.
